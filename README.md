## Welcome to Alex's Portfolio

I am a Computer Science Graduate of SDSU experienced in developing, testing, debugging code and object-oriented programming. My projects are mostly comprised of building games/applications and websites, especially in a collaborative team. Aside from coding, I love to learn my favorite songs on the piano!
