## About Me

I am a Computer Science Graduate of SDSU experienced in developing, testing, debugging code and object-oriented programming. My projects are mostly comprised of building games/applications and websites, especially in a collaborative team. Aside from coding, I love to learn his favorite songs on the piano!

### Projects
This [Resort Reservation System](https://github.com/chauduthuan/ResortReservationSystem) is a webpage where visitors can learn about the resort and register to become customers; customers can reserve rooms, and employees can manage customers. I developed the Landing Page you see in the image and worked with 6 others to create the whole system.
